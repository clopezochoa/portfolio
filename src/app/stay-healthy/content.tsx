    <span>After prototyping the capstone project of a course by IBM about frontend engineering,<br/>
    a React app had to be made to grant functionality to a static design in plain HTML and CSS.<br/>
    Since my first visit to react.dev I realized that next.js was my best chance to deploy all<br/>
    the typescript I have learnt over the last years while working as both front end and backend<br/>
    developer.<br/>
    <br/>
    To elevate the experience of creating the app, I underwent a brief investigation on user personas around me.<br/>
    What caught my attention was the increasing medical services for a broad variety of users, some of which<br/>
    are not technologically savvy.<br/>
